# CombatFlite-to-TheWay-Converter
Converts your flight plan from CombatFlite to files which can be used by TheWay to stick your flight plans into your jet in DCS.

3 directories need to be created - this program does not do so automatically. These directories go in the root folder.

CF_File
Extracted_CF
TW_Files

You stick your combatflite .cf file into the CF_File directory, then run the program and follow the instructions.

The final .tw files will be created in the TW_Files directory.

Use the delete files button in the GUI to clear the Extracted_CF and TW_Files directories to prevent file conflicts.
